!!! Info
    Applicable to: Robo Advisor, Self Investor, StoryTeller

## Context

To provide to your customers the services and products of the InvestSuite wealthtech-as-a-service platform the first steps in the process are - in that order - to create a user and a portfolio. To create a user register the user ID identifying the customer in your system. Then use the InvestSuite ID the API returns to create a portfolio with the user as owner.

To offer access to InvestSuite products you open an account on behalf of your clients. Opening an account requires passing the data you request via an app or web site, or sending the data stored in your banking system or CRM. The data that are required are two-fold. Firstly an identifier to reference the user, and secondly a Portfolio object assigned to the user.

User objects serve two purposes. Firstly to grant access to one or more InvestSuite products i.e. StoryTeller, Robo Advisor, Self Investor or the Admin Console. Secondly to assign users as owners to one or more portfolios. To create a user a limited number of fields are required...

## Create a user

Prior to creating the user in the InvestSuite platform you are assumed to register that user at your end as a customer in the database or CRM of your choice. The ID of the user in that system you add to the InvestSuite system in the `external_id` field, also called the _Reference ID_.

Next to your user ID you can optionally register the first name and last name. Let’s now create a user and then see why adding the user’s first name and last name may be a good idea.

=== "HTTP"

    ```HTTP 
    POST /users/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.sandbox.investsuite.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJ...

    {
        "external_id": "unique_external_entity_id",
        "first_name": "Ashok",
        "last_name": "Kumar"
    }

    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \                 
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Auhorization": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJ..."  \   
    -d '{  \   
            "external_id": "unique_external_entity_id",  \   
            "first_name": "Ashok", \
            "last_name": "Kumar", \
        }'
    https://api.sandbox.investsuite.com/users/
    ```

Field | Description | Data type | Example | Required
----- | ----------- | --------- | ------- | --------
`external_id` | A unique external identifier for this entity, also referred to as Reference ID. This identifier can be any string used in your system to identify this entity. This field is not checked for uniqueness. | `string <= 64 characters` | unique_external_entity_id | no 
`first_name` | The first name of the user. | `string <= 128 characters` | Ashok | no
`last_name` | The last name of the user. | `string <= 128 characters` | Kumar | no

**Response body** 

```JSON
{
    "external_id": "unique_external_entity_id",
    "id": "U01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "creation_datetime": "2021-02-18T08:21:02+00:00",
    "version": 1,
    "version_datetime": "2021-02-18T08:21:02+00:00",

    "deleted": false,
    "first_name": "Ashok",
    "last_name": "Kumar",
}
```

Now that you have successfully registered the user you can find that user in the InvestSuite Admin Console. Contact your representative to get credentials to access the Admin Console. Having provided the user’s name now comes in handy.

What else:

* You can create [logins for your customers](#create-login) for them to view and manage their portfolios. (Next)
* You can [add the counter account](#add-a-counter-account) for withdrawal instructions.
* You can [change (“patch”) fields](../users/#change-patch-fields).
* You can [delete the user](../users/#delete-a-user).
* You can [search for users](../users/#search) by Reference ID, the user’s name etc.

## Create login

InvestSuite prefers not to store personal data (PII) in the InvestSuite platform. Instead we merely demand an identifier to reference your client. However if you want to create credentials on the InvestSuite platform so that your user can log in to the platform, or in fact to the front-ends exposing the platform, you need to register the user’s e-mail address and mobile number.

=== "HTTP"

    ```HTTP 
    POST /users/?create_idp_user=true HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.sandbox.investsuite.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJ...

    {
        "external_id": "unique_external_entity_id",
        "first_name": "Ashok",
        "last_name": "Kumar",
        "email": "ashok.kumar@example.com",
        "phone": "+12345667"
    }

    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \                 
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Auhorization": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJ..."  \   
    -d '{  \   
            "external_id": "unique_external_entity_id",  \   
            "first_name": "Ashok", \
            "last_name": "Kumar", \
            "email": "ashok.kumar@example.com", \
            "phone": "+123456789"
        }'
    https://api.sandbox.investsuite.com/users/?create_idp_user=true
    ```

By passing the e-mail address and phone number of your client you make InvestSuite register the user in the identify platform (IdP) linked to your configuration - which in most cases is Azure ADB2C. Since e-mail and phone number are required to identify your customer in the identify platform both fields are required to be unique. On top, these fields are _write once_. You cannot update them.

Field | Description | Data type | Example | Required
----- | ----------- | --------- | ------- | --------
`email` | The e-mail address of the user. Unique and write once. | `email` | ashok.kumar@example.com | no 
`phone` | The mobile phone number of the user in international format. Unique and write once. | `string (^\+[1-9][0-9]{7,15}\Z)` | +123456789 | no

When the user is registered in the IdP for a customer, that customer can then go through a process to obtain a password. This process takes place outside of InvestSuite and the bank and requires the user to access the identity platform immediately.

Now, with the e-mail address and the password the user can authenticate against the IdP. When authentication is successful the IdP returns a JWT. You can then add the InvestSuite User ID in the JWT claims to interact with the API on behalf of that user, for instance going through risk profiling on the person’s behalf, retrieving portfolio data, issuing buy or sell orders etc.

## Add a counter account

You can optionally add a counter account. This is used to display to your customer the account that is funded in case of a withdrawal instruction. In some cases banks allow the customer to modify the counter account via its front-end.

**What is a portfolio to InvestSuite** - An investment portfolio in the classical sense of the term is a collection of financial assets grouped with the aim of earning a profit. These assets are referred to as holdings. Alongside holdings, portfolio objects in the InvestSuite platform contain general info, for instance to display to the customer, and configuration settings to manage the portfolio. An example of general info is a portfolio name e.g. My Retirement Portfolio, an example of configuration settings are the active boolean to indicate that trading is allowed for a portfolio and the risk profile the customer had set for the portfolio.
