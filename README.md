# InvestSuite API documentation

This API documentation is generated with the *downright gorgeous* MkDocs static site generator. To run this repository locally, follow their instructions at https://www.mkdocs.org/.

The InvestSuite API documentation describes by means of walkthroughs and in depth topics the API InvestSuite maintains for developers to integrate with our products and services. As documentation it complements the API specifications at https://api.sandbox.investsuite.com/redoc aiming to present what is in the there in a less formal, more instructive way. Our inspiration comes from the Teach Don't Document article by Delip Rao at https://deliprao.com/teach-dont-document.
